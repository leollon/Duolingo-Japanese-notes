たち (tachi) is indeed a plural suffix, but not for かれ (kare). Use ら (ra) instead, which is also a plural suffix.

かれら (karera) is usually for males, but can be used for both of the genders.

    私たち (watashi-tachi) = we/us

    貴方たち (anata-tachi) = you guys/ladies.

    彼ら (karera) = they/them (males/mixed).

    彼女たち (kanojo-tachi) = they/them (females).
